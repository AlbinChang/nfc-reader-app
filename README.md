#Introduction
---
1. This is an andriod app to update image of E-ink screen on NFC-WISP tag by tapping cell-phone onto it.
The app is tested on Nexus S, using CyanogenMod 11 OS (Andriod Version 4.4.4.). It only works with NFC-WISP 1.0 hareware and **nfc-eink-img-update-demo** firmware (see README.md in [firmware repo](https://github.com/wisp/nfc-wisp-fw.git        )). The older pre-release code is taged as **"pre-release"**.

2. The project is configured for target Andriod OS 4.4 (API19), please modify it if you are using different target.
